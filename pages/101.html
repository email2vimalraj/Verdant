				<p class="contentall col-xs-12">Flamebloc GS 101 is a ready-to-use flame retardant for use on synthetic fabric fibers such as polyester, rayon, acrylic, etc. Flamebloc GS 101 is an aqueous solution containing polymeric aminopolyphosphate and a mixture of brominated salts as its active ingredients. There are no polybrominated diphenyl ethers in the composition. Upon exposure to heat and flame, a char forms on the surface of the fabric which acts as a fire, heat and smoke barrier. The proprietary active ingredients of this product contribute to flame resistance by melting below flaming temperatures and resolidifying in the form of carbon (char) that acts as a barrier between the fabric and the flame. As a result, Flamebloc GS 101 will decrease smoke evolution. In addition, it will also provide resistance to flameless combustion, referred to as afterglow.</p>

					<h5><b>APPLICATION</b></h5>
					<p class="contentall">Flamebloc GS 101 is highly penetrating and can be added to synthetic fabrics during any stage of the manufacturing process as long as there is no water phase rinsing or cleaning process that occurs to the fabric post fabric being treated. Flamebloc GS 101 is not permanent to the fabric because there is no chemical bonding and thus, treatment will have to be reapplied after any machine washing or water rinsing. Flamebloc GS 101 is water soluble product easily washed off with soap and water. Flamebloc GS 101 is water based, has a low toxicity, contains no VOC, is non-volatile, contains no petroleum derivatives and is non-flammable and non-combustible. Applied on fabric, it is highly versatile as fabric can be sprayed or dipped in solutions of Flamebloc GS 101.</p>
