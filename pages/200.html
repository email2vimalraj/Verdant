				<span class="contentall">Flamebloc GS 200 is a ready-to-use flame retardant for use on uncoated wood requiring class “A” flame retardant testing protocol. Flamebloc GS 200 is an aqueous solution containing polymeric aminopolyphosphate. There are no polybrominated diphenyl ethers in the composition. Upon exposure to heat and flame, a carbon char and a very thin foam form on the surface of the wood as a fire, heat and smoke barrier. The proprietary active ingredients of this product contribute to flame resistance by melting below flaming temperatures and then resolidifying in the form of carbon (char) thus producing a thin layer of foam as well as char that acts as a barrier between the wood substrate and the flame. As a result, Flamebloc GS 200 will cause a decrease in smoke evolution. In addition, it will also provide resistance to flameless combustion, referred to as afterglow. Flamebloc GS 200 is an extremely deep penetrating material and can be applied during various stages of wood processing. This product is water based, has a low toxicity, contains no VOC, is non-volatile, contains no petroleum derivatives and is non-flammable and non-combustible. Applied on wood, it is highly versatile. Wood substrate can be sprayed or dipped in Flamebloc GS 200.</span></br>

					<h5><b>APPLICATION</b></h5>
					Flamebloc GS 200 can also be applied to wood during any stage of process prior to any coating or sealant being used. Treated wood should not be exposed to the exterior environment to avoid contact with moisture or water until the wood has been coated. Wood treated for interior environments require no special precautions prior to its use unless it is exposed to moisture. Flamebloc GS 200 is not permanent to the wood substrate because there is no chemical bonding and thus, for exterior applications will require being top coated or sealed with an appropriate coating prior to the woods used. Flamebloc GS 200 is a water soluble product that can be washed off with hot, soapy water.
