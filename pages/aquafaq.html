                          These Nano size crystals will either flow through an open system in colloidal suspension, settle at the low point of a system (can be flushed by implementing a maintenance program) or can be easily filtered down stream of the Conditioner. Any residue left on a surface is easily removed.

                        Several factors need to be taken into consideration.

                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                        In many instances the thickness of scale in the water carrying system has taken a number of weeks, months and years to build up. Once installed conditioner will begin to work immediately in reversing the scale build up, however it may take equally as long or longer to remove the existing scale as it took for the scale to depositor build up.

                          The only way that you can remove minerals from water is reverse osmosis which strips the water of all minerals and nutrients giving you essentially water that is good for car batteries.

                        </uib-accordion-heading>
                          In the first instance if the steam boiler is in a recirculating system you would always install the conditioner in the recirculating loop so that the water is conditioned every time it is circulated through the system.  Doing this is better than only treating the water once. The more often the water is treated the better the result. The minerals may collect at the lowest point or they may flow through the system.

                          No. It is important to select the correct size Conditioner for your application. Selection of a conditioner is simple! What you need to know is;

                        </uib-accordion-heading>
                          Yes, because of the definite change in the characteristics of the minerals (electrical charge), the surface tension of the water is reduced giving you softer, “wetter” water.

                            Chemical free, salt free, maintenance free, no moving parts, most important no electricity cost and drainage water through this is ECO-FRIENDLY. The conditioners could also be installed as a pretreatment to softeners or RO systems improving their performance.

                            </uib-accordion-heading>

                            If the flow rate would drop dramatically the conditioner may work at reduced efficiency.  With an increased flow rate at input the only sacrifice would be a decrease in water pressure at the outlet.The harder the conditioner works the better the result.

                            17. Does the change in pressure affect the flow rate of water passing through the conditioner? </br> For eg: if with an X pressure pump the flow rate is 34lpm(liters per minute) then with the Y pressure pump can this lpm value change?  <i class="pull-right glyphicon" ng-class="{'glyphicon-chevron-down': status.open, 'glyphicon-chevron-right': !status.open}"></i>
                            </uib-accordion-heading>

                            If the pressure dropped from 75 PSI to 10 PSI then there may be a difference. Generally pressure has not been a concern in conditioners functionality; conditioners that are installed on gravity fed systems too are working. Ideal situation would be to have a flow rate with pressure.  The harder the conditioner works the better the result.

If ‘with an increased flow rate the sacrifice would be decrease in water pressure’ but will the conditioner continue to do its function still? </br>Will the water at the outlet still be conditioned? <i class="pull-right glyphicon" ng-class="{'glyphicon-chevron-down': status.open, 'glyphicon-chevron-right': !status.open}"></i>

                            Yes, as the flow rate increase the water being forced through the conditioner will make the conditioner more effective. The downside is that if you put 60l/min through a conditioner that was designed for a flow rate of 20l/min the sacrifice would be a pressure drop on the outlet side of the conditioner. There would be a higher pressure on the inlet side pushing the water through the system.  In the first instance we would not select a conditioner with a flow rate of 20l/min for a 60l/min application.  Selecting the correct conditioner is critical and that’s our job to help you do that.

                            If pressure was not critical you should select the Model AC18 with an average flow rate of 18l/min. The advantage to you would be;

                            No, our conditioners can be installed on any system.

                            The conditioner would certainly work in this situation, that’s what it is designed to do.  We have our systems installed on underground mining equipment where the TDS of the water is over 400,000ppm.  So no matter how hard we know that our system will make a difference.

                            The alloy will make a difference to all the minerals found in the water.  We are not aware of any that have been extremely troublesome.

                            We have had customers who have just used our conditioner only in high iron content bore water.  They still had some staying but what was there was more easily wiped away.  We have used drinking water systems in the USA incorporating our conditioner and filtration to reeve odor and some color from the water stream. Installing a conditioner only may have an effect on its own.

                            First up just like our bodies, plants and crops need the minerals in water to survive.  Give plant RO water and it won’t be healthy.  Conditioning well water for irrigation does the following;

                                    <li>Makes the water softer</li>

                                    <li>Minerals do not form a crust on the soil surface which causes runoff of irrigation water</li>
                                    <li>Softer water is more easily absorbed into the ground</li>
                                    <li>Softer water penetrates the soil deeper encouraging deeper root growth and more feared roots</li>
