					<h5><b>Manufactured in Australia</b></h5>
					Aqua Conditioners manufactures all its products in Australia using proprietory technology, which is well tested and used by industries and homes, since 1983. Our products are manufactured using a technologically advanced manufacturing and servicing facility to provide customers with the best equipment at the best possible price. Each Aqua Conditioner goes through stringent quality checks before it is packaged and distributed. Thus once installed there are no worries about the unit failing or needing maintenance.

					<h5><b>What is a Aqua Conditioner system?</b></h5>
					According to some very narrow definitions a ‘water-softener’ changes hard water into soft water only with the removal of calcium from the water with sodium carbonate. This means the Aqua Conditioners unit is not technically a water softener as it does not add chemicals or remove any minerals from the water flow. However, it does turn ‘hard water‘ into ‘soft water’ as characteristics of the calcium molecules changes so that it does not drop out and cling to other surfaces. The Aqua Conditioners device prevents scale from forming by neutralizing the scale producing properties of the minerals in hard water. This means the neutralized mineral particles will flow freely through the system without sticking to the surfaces.

					<h5><b>What does the Aqua Conditioners technology do?</b></h5>
					The technology is designed to protect plumbing systems and other surfaces from the negative effects of hard water minerals. The scale and residue that usually sticks to pipes, valves and other surfaces is prevented from forming by changing the hard minerals in the water into inactive microscopic particles. These inactive mineral particles stay suspended in the water (much like minerals are suspended in milk) and flow freely, unable to stick to surfaces.</br></br>
					Most importantly, unlike hard water minerals, if the inactive mineral particles occasionally drop out of suspension they can easily be washed or wiped away without the use of caustic chemicals.

					<h5><b>How does a Aqua Conditioners work?</b></h5>
					The unit is installed directly in your water line. It has at its core a non-sacrificial, catalytic converter that is non-ferrous, resists rusting and corrosion, and is totally non-toxic and ecologically safe. The unit requires no salt, no resins, no electricity, no magnets, no back washing and no maintenance.</br></br>Using a unique combination of metals within the alloy core plus the principle of turbulence (the Venturi effect), the water flow is forced through the Aqua Conditioners unit where an electro-chemical catalytic reaction occurs. During this reaction, electrons are transferred between molecules, completing missing electrons and so new mineral compounds are formed. The electro-physical changes in the minerals neutralize their scale producing properties.</br></br>The result is that previously ‘hard’ minerals are changed from being large molecules into inactive, microscopic mineral particles.
