							<h3><b>The Hard Water Problem</b></h3>
							<p class="contentall col-xs-11">In a nursery the region and state were at the beginning of one of the worst droughts seen in recent times.  Irrigation water for the nursery was kept in large dams on 	the property but without rain to naturally fill the dams water would need to be pumped up from the bore (well).</p>
							<p class="contentall col-xs-11">The irrigation water quality problem with the nursery’s bore (well) water is that it has a high salt and iron content.  The combined salt levels are 3600 ppm and the 	iron levels are around 6mg, which is extreme.</p>

							<ul>
                                <li><i class="fa fa-thumbs-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> One affect of using the bore water with such high iron levels to irrigate the large cross section of plants was to turn them bright orange within 3 hours of contact. This made the plants far less saleable.</li></br>
                                <li><i class="fa fa-thumbs-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> The other affect is that the growth of the plants is stunted and very slow.</li>
                            </ul>

						<div class="col-md-12">
							<p class="contentall col-xs-11">The NGIQ (Nursery & Garden Industry) representative warned owner not to use the bore water for irrigation as it would badly damage his plant stock.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="col-md-12"><h5><b>The Common Solution</b></h5></div>
						
						<div class="col-md-12">
							<p class="contentall col-xs-11">Droughts are times of high expense when nurserymen commonly outlay thousands of dollars to truck in water. As owner looked around for water quality solutions to his dilemma he never imagined there would be any return on his investment.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="col-md-8">
							<ul>
                                <li><i class="fa fa-thumbs-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> One common way to control iron in water is to pump the water into a holding tank or dam (pond) and aerate it. This allows the iron to precipitate out and quickly sink to the bottom. The water is then drawn out using a floating suction.</li></br>
                                <li><i class="fa fa-thumbs-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> In the case of unusable bore water (as the NGIQ told owner his water) for irrigation is regularly trucked in and stored in tanks.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <div class="col-md-12 no-padding"><h5><b>The Best Hard Water Solution</b></h5></div>

                            <p class="contentall col-xs-11">The bore water was pumped through a small Conditioner unit that suited the flow rate of the bore, it was pointed skyward for aeration and a small dam was filled.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="col-md-4"><img src="_img/casestudy/cattle_drinking_at_the_dam.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive"></div>

                        <div class="col-md-12">
                        	<p class="contentall col-xs-11">The dam settled over a couple of days and soon became so absolutely crystal clear that horses and cows were falling into the water because they could not comprehend that the water got deeper as they moved in!</p>

                        	<p class="contentall col-xs-11">With the main irrigation dam almost empty the dam with the treated bore water was used to irrigate plant stock. A second Conditioner was installed on the water tank so then the bore water ran through a unit into a holding dam, pumped from the holding dam through a unit into a storage tank which then irrigated the plants around the Nursery.</p>

						<div class="col-md-12">
							<p class="contentall col-xs-11">Knowing how to make cut flowers last longer is a dilemma faced not only by florists but by growers on a daily basis. A family owns and operate the Rose Farm. They export 40 million roses to Europe annually so making sure those blooms stay fresh for as long as possible is an absolute necessity for their business.</p>
							<p class="contentall col-xs-11">The Aqua Conditioner Solution</p>
							<p class="contentall col-xs-11">Hard water from a bore (well) typically has very high surface tension. This inhibits the ability of the water to be taken up into the plant stem and absorbed into the cell structure. It is water that supports the stems and keeps them firm and straight and if it is not well absorbed then the plant quickly becomes dehydrated and wilts.</p>
							<p class="contentall col-xs-11">On the other hand any hard water that is treated with a non-chemical, non-electrical Aqua Conditioner becomes ‘softer’. This means that the surface tension of the water is lowered significantly. This then allows the water and minerals to be easily drawn up by the plant. The water provides support and the minerals provide nourishment so that the plant survives for a longer period of time.</p>
							<p class="contentall col-xs-11">Below is a photo diary of a test carried out using water from the farm’s bore. One vase of roses was placed in water that had been drawn from a bore (well) with a Aqua Conditioner attached and the other vase was straight, untreated bore water.</p>

							<h3><b>Plastic Manufacturing Factory</b></h3>
							<h5><b>Hard Water Problems &amp; Solutions</b></h5>
							<p class="contentall">With all that’s required to run a successful manufacturing business the last thing a business needs is to have added headaches because the air conditioning isn’t working as well as it could.</p>
							<h5><b>Dealing with the Problem</b></h5>
							<p class="contentall">The management at Plastics manufacturing factory found their cooling tower was needing so much maintenance to keep the air conditioning operating at capacity for their factory that they had to have dedicated maintenance personnel. The hard water scale was building up so thick and so fast in the pipes and the cooling tower that they had to do acid dosing on a weekly basis.</p>

						<div class="col-md-4"><img src="_img/casestudy/anti-scale-device-india-1.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive"></div>

						<div class="col-md-12 col-xs-11">
							<h5><b>The Solution</b></h5>
							<p class="contentall">Management installed the Aqua Conditioner as an anti-scale device and found that not only did it stop new scale from building up it also dissolved the existing scale.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="col-md-12 col-xs-11">
							<h5><b>The Result</b></h5>
							<p class="contentall">The director was very pleased to report that in the 5 years since the installation there has been no scale build up whatsoever! No more hard water problems – just solutions!</p>

							<h3><b>Paper Manufacturing Mill</b></h3>
							<h5><b>Solving Hard Water Problems in Industry</b></h5>
							<p class="contentall">With the massive volumes of water required in paper pulping processing it’s little wonder that a paper mill began to experience equipment failure.</p>
							<h5><b>Dealing with the Problem</b></h5>
							<p class="contentall">Massive vacuum pumps are used for extracting water from the paper pulp and waste water is an obvious by-product of the pulping process.</p>
							<p class="contentall">The hard water was causing significant damage to the pumping equipment. The calcium scale was building up very quickly and causing blockages to the point that heavy duty maintenance was needed every month to clear the pipes and pumps. This was a massive undertaking for the maintenance crew.</p>

						<div class="col-md-4 col-xs-11"><img src="_img/casestudy/anti-scale-device-india-2.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive"></div>

						<div class="col-md-12 col-xs-11">
							<h5><b>The Solution</b></h5>
							<p class="contentall">A custom built Aqua Conditioner was commissioned (based on water volume and flow rates) for this particular application. At schedule maintenance the unit was installed.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="col-md-12 col-xs-11">
							<h5><b>The Result</b></h5>
							<p class="contentall">No blocking of vacuum pumps!</p>
							<p class="contentall">Even after many months of faultless operation clearly the Aqua Conditioner does its job well. The maintenance engineer was so impressed with the performance results and the quality of the waste water produced that more installations are planned.</p>
