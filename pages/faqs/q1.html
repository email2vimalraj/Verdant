	<div class="accordion_content">Conditioner’s use is a combination of both physics and chemistry to change the electrical charge (zeta potential) of the minerals in water by a factor of almost 2.
	<p></p>
	<p><strong>PHYSICS:</strong></p>
	<ul class="dotted">
		<li>Water directly contacts the conditioner’s specifically designed and engineered patented alloy core.</li>
		<li>The core is figured to create a high degree of turbulence to occur in the water flow, and provides a more pronounced exposure and contact between the crystalline mineral particles and the metals in the alloy core.</li>
		<li>Nano sized crystals are formed.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p></p>
	<p><strong>CHEMISTRY:</strong></p>
	<ul class="dotted">
		<li>Each Conditioner’s patented alloy core is foundry blended with metals scientifically selected from both the cathode and anode end of the galvanic scale.</li>
		<li>On contact with water the Conditioner’s core creates an electro-chemical (galvanic) reaction between the crystalline minerals in the water and the catalytic alloy core and the mineral begin to be dispersed into a colloidal solution.</li>
		<li>Nuclei have been introduced into the system as a result of the cathode-anode reaction and provide a more positive site around which the mineral particles can attract, as opposed to precipitating onto the walls of piping or equipment. The scientific name for this reaction is more readily known as “epitaxial nucleation”.</li>
		<li>Colloids do not settle or precipitate (much like milk) therefor reducing problems associated with hard water.</li>
		
		<li>The patented catalytic alloy in the Conditioner generates an electro-chemical (galvanic) reaction causing the minerals to flocculate as a colloid. Colloids do not settle or precipitate (form scale) but always stay in solution. Milk is a colloid, with billions of nano sized particles which stay permanently in solution.</li>
